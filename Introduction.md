Rather than writing a full book, gwt-gae-book complements existing online materials in a logical, structured, easy to follow way. With the help of community, this set of guides and samples intends to
  * Introduce engineers to GWT and GAE
  * Show by example best practices for implementing common functionality
  * Complement and heavily reference existing online materials, rather than duplicating existing contents


# Why a free, online book? #

I believe the world (both people and technology) is better through collaboration, sharing of knowledge and [having the right to read](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/right-to-read.html).

By free education (even in the form of this small book), anybody has the choice of learning and getting better, rather than just the ones who can afford it. With free programming languages, libraries, tools and documentation, we'll see better applications, more and better collaborative ideas on improving them, and a better hiring market for software development companies. Will technical book authors die of hunger? No, they'll just have to consider doing something else for profit rather than writing books all life (which they probably already do). Hopefully donations will also help a little.

I personally avoid traditional technical books as
  * Technology moves fast. A well prepared, printed material will usually be partially outdated by the time you purchase it. Fact: there is no GWT 2.0 traditional book almost one year later after GWT 2.0 release.
  * Much of the contents which make up a technical book already exist online, in the form of product documentation, tutorials, code samples, blog posts, group discussions.
  * Authors usually [get less than 10% from book sales](http://askville.amazon.com/profit-make-book-published/AnswerViewer.do?requestId=4387206). If you found this book useful, please [make a donation](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=ZYVQ36QASGH2W&lc=RO&item_name=GWT%20GAE%20online%20book&currency_code=EUR&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donate_SM%2egif%3aNonHosted).

# How to read this book #

Most of the sections have links to additional materials. Read the pre-requisites before going further and go through other references as you encounter them.

There are also some exercises. Give your best shot at solving them rather than just reading the solution, it really helps. Who knows, you might even discover better ways of doing things.

# About the author #

I'm a software engineer living in Bucharest, Romania. Besides developing software, which I do both for making a living and fun, I love mountain trekking, bike riding, dancing, listening to music and the sound of growing grass, and contemplating the beauties of [Earth](http://picasaweb.google.com/Marius.Andreiana2/200909AzugaBrebu#5381658896815102626) and [Universe](http://picasaweb.google.com/Marius.Andreiana2/201006SanFrancisco#5479737052835259090).
