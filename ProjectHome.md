# Mission #
To introduce engineers on how to professionally develop applications using Google Web Toolkit and App Engine by developing a full real application step by step.

# How #
Rather than writing a full book, gwt-gae-book complements existing online materials in a logical, structured, easy to follow way. With the help of community, this set of guides and samples intends to
  * Introduce engineers to GWT and GAE
  * Show by example best practices for implementing common functionality
  * Complement and heavily reference existing online materials, rather than duplicating existing contents

Along the book, we'll develop a full real application used to practically illustrate the concepts explained.
